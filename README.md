# File Names, Project Organization and Virtual EnvironmentsÂ¶

This repo was used to complete Assignment 6. In this module we explored

 - project structure
 - file/folder naming
 - creating a README.md
 - using the .gitignore file
 - using commit and commit messages


Repo is meant to show that I understood these concepts.
